# Java GUI ToDo App

## About This Project

This is a simple To-Do List application built using Java Swing.
It was created as a small learning project to understand how GUI (Graphical User Interface) works in Java.

I’m a beginner and had no idea about Swing or GUI programming before starting this. I built this step-by-step by taking help from ChatGPT, Google, and different online tutorials. Since I was learning everything from scratch, I have written comments for almost every line of the code to explain what each part does in a simple way.

This project helped me understand:

What Swing is used for

How to create buttons, text fields, and labels in a GUI

How event handling works (like clicking buttons)

How to use JFrame, JPanel, JButton, JTextField, etc.

## Features

View all tasks

Simple and beginner-friendly GUI

All comments included for better understanding

## Notes

This project is not meant to be perfect or professional.

It was made for learning and practice only.

I took help from ChatGPT, Google, and documentation to write and understand each part.

The comments inside the code are written by me to make it easy for any beginner like me to understand.

 ## Acknowledgment

Special thanks to ChatGPT, Google, and all online resources** that helped me understand how Java Swing works.
This is my first small step into Java GUI programming.
